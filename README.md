## 🔐 Data & Privacy

UniDesk is local-first. User data is stored on the local machine, including settings, shortcuts, todos, quick notes, quick text, and icon cache.

Clipboard history includes sensitive-content filtering to reduce accidental storage of verification codes, passwords, tokens, cookies, and similar text. This lowers risk, but it should not be treated as an absolute security guarantee. If you handle highly sensitive content, consider disabling clipboard history or clearing it regularly.

## 🆕 Highlights

Recent versions include:

- Module management with show / hide and ordering.
- Shortcut drag-to-add and free ordering.
- Quick Notes with multiple notes, auto save, pinning, and copy.
- Quick Text with clipboard history, text snippets, and sensitive-content filtering.
- Improved hardware monitor layout for CPU, memory, GPU, temperature, and RX / TX network speed.
- Improved GPU temperature reading for more hardware and driver environments.
- Improved personalization settings and main panel scrolling.

## 📌 Roadmap

- More theme presets.
- More detailed hardware information.
- More flexible module extension options.
- Better installation and update experience.
